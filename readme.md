Overview
=

The data and code were created for the review of the paper "GPT-based Text-to-SQL for Spatial Databases" and the code is adapted from [DAIL-SQL](https://github.com/BeachWang/DAIL-SQL).

Datasets
=

The folder `sdbdatasets` contains the datasets we created specifically for spatial databases, including `dataset1` and `dataset2` (We need to extract the compressed files in the folder `sdbdatasets`). <br>
* The file `ada.sqlite` is an SQLite database file (We can use [spatialite-gui](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite_gui/index), an open-source graphical user interface tool, to manage SQLite database files). <br>
* The file `ada.table.csv` contains geographic region descriptions for each database table, supporting both Chinese and English. <br>
* The file `QA-ada-56.txt` stores questions and answers based on the ada database. <br>

Below is an example from the file `QA-ada-56.txt`: <br>

     label:G S
     questionCHI:请问太湖的面积是多少？
     evidenceCHI:太湖是由多个名称相同的湖泊区域组成。只需给出面积。
     nameCHI:太湖以'太湖'为名称表示。
     question:What is the area of Lake Tai?
     evidence:Lake Tai is composed of multiple sections of water with the same name. Only provide the area.
     name:Lake Tai is represented by the name '太湖'.
     SQL: Select Sum(Area)  from lakes where name = '太湖'  %%% Select Sum(Area(Shape, 1))   from lakes where name = '太湖'
     Eval: Select Sum(Area)  from lakes where name = '太湖'  %%% Select Sum(Area(Shape, 1))   from lakes where name = '太湖'
     id: ada01
 




The meaning of each field is as follows:  


     |Field       | Description  
     |------------|-------
     |label       | For the SQL queries related to the question, 'G' denotes a general query, and 'S' represents a spatial query.
     |question    | The question in natural language. 
     |evidence    | Supporting knowledge.
     |name        | Real values of some phrases from the 'question' field in the database. 
     |questionCHI | The Chinese translation of the 'question' field.
     |evidenceCHI | The Chinese translation of the 'evidence' field.
     |nameCHI     | The Chinese translation of the 'name' field.
     |SQL         | The SQL query corresponding to the 'question' field. Due to derived columns, there may be multiple SQL queries, separated by '%%%'. 
     |Eval        | SQL queries corresponding to all results. When evaluating the predicted SQL queries with execution accuracy, results like 'Area(Intersection(a.Shape, b.Shape) 1)' and 'Area(Intersection(b.Shape, a.Shape) 1)' may differ. 
     |id          | The unique ID for the question.  


In `dataset2`, there are also four databases: `ada`, `edu`, `tourism`, and `traffic`.  
* The `tourism` database in `dataset2` is the same as the `tourism` database in `dataset1`.  
* The `ada`, `edu`, and `traffic` databases in `dataset2`  are derived from the corresponding databases in `dataset1`  by removing the derived columns.  
* The questions in both `dataset1`  and `dataset2`  are identical for each database.

Experiments
=

The `experiments` folder contains the `results` folder and four types of datasets, which are derived from various combinations of data in the `sdbdatasets` folder (We  also need to extract the compressed files in the folder `experiments`).
* The folder `dataset1_ada_edu` indicates that the training set is built using data from the `tourism` and `traffic` databases in `dataset1`, and predictions are made for questions related to the `ada` and `edu` databases.
* The folder `dataset1_tourism_traffic` indicates that the training set is built using data from the `ada` and `edu` databases in `dataset1`, and predictions are made for questions related to the `tourism` and `traffic` databases.
* The folder `dataset2_ada_edu` indicates that the training set is built using data from the `tourism` and `traffic` databases in `dataset2`, and predictions are made for questions related to the ada and edu databases.
* The folder `dataset2_tourism_traffic` indicates that the training set is built using data from the `ada` and `edu` databases in `dataset2`, and predictions are made for questions related to the `tourism` and `traffic` databases.


Environment Setup
=
    

   To set up the environment, you should download the [Stanford CoreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05.zip), unzip it to the folder `./third_party/`, and rename `stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05` to `stanfordnlp`. Next, you need to launch the coreNLP server:



    install default-jre
    install default-jdk
    cd third_party/stanfordnlp
    java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -port 9000 -timeout 15000


   
   In addition,
   
   

    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python nltk_downloader.py



   You can refer to the installation steps at https://github.com/BeachWang/DAIL-SQL.

Run
======

Data Preprocess
------
This step includes copying databases from `sdbdatasets` to the corresponding folders (`experiments/dataset1_ada_edu`, `experiments/dataset1_tourism_traffic`,  `experiments/dataset2_ada_edu`, and `experiments/dataset2_tourism_traffic`) and applying required processing operations.


    
    python data_preprocess.py


   
Prompt Generation
------
This step will generate corresponding prompts for each method (dail_sql, sspa, sspa_geo, sspa_sdbms, sspa_tips) across different datasets (dataset1, dataset2) and scenarios (shot-0, shot-1, shot-3, shot-5).

    
    python generate_question.py

8. Calling the LLM

   python ask_llm.py --data_type 1 --algo sspa --shot 5 --model gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09
   
  The parameter 'model' refers to the GPT model used in our experiments, specifically 'gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09'. Additionally, you need to modify the 'api_key' and 'base_url' parameters in **llm/chatgpt.py**.

9. Evaluation
   python eval2.py --data_type 1 --algo sspa --shot 5

10. Statistics
   python calculate.py
   
  The calculate.py script is used to compute the statistics for all experimental results. The data for the charts in the paper is sourced from the file **experiments/results/statistics.txt**.
